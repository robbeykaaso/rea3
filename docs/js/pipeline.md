# Abstract
* manage self pipes' life  
* the stream data supports types of `string`, `number`, `bool`, `array`, `object` and the customized type in rea-c++  

# API
* **add(aFunc, aParam = {})**  
    - add a pipe of the specific type into the pipeline  
    - `aFunc` is the function to be executed  
    - `aParam` is the pipe parameter  
    - `return` the specific pipe  
_sample_:  
```
pipelines().add(function(aInput){
    aInput.out()
}, {
    "name", "pipe0",  //the name of the pipe, if there is no name, it will be regarded as an anonymous pipe
    "external", "c++"  //decide which pipeline controls its next pipes
})
```  
</br>

* **find(aName, aNeedFuture = true)**  
    - find the specific pipe by name  
    - `aName` is the pipe name  
    - `aNeedFuture` is used for the case that the pipe is not existed now, but will be existed in the future or other pipelines  
    - `return` the pipe  
</br>

* **run(aName, aInput, aTag = "", aScope = null)**  
    - execute the specific pipe by name and start a business procedure  
    - `aName` is the pipe name  
    - `aInput` is the input stream data  
    - `aTag` is the tag name of the stream  
    - `aScope` is the stream additional data  
    - `return` the input stream  
_sample_:
```
pipelines().run("pathSelected", {path: ""}, "service1")
```  
</br>

* **call(aName, aInput, aScope = null)**  
    - only execute the specific pipe and its aspects synchronously  
    - `aName` is the pipe name  
    - `aInput` is the input data  
    - `aScope` is the stream additional data  
    - `return` the input stream  
</br>

* **input(aInput, aTag = "", aScope = null, aAutoTag = false)**  
    - generate a stream by the input data  
    - `aInput` is the input data  
    - `aTag` is the tag name of the stream  
    - `aScopeCache` is the stream additional data  
    - `aAutoTag` denotes whether to auto generating the tag if the input tag is ""  
    - `return` the generated stream  
</br>

* **remove(aName, aOutside = false)**  
    - remove the specific pipe in this pipeline or in all pipelines  
    - `aName` is the pipe name  
    - `aOutside` is whether to remove the samed name pipe of all the pipelines  
</br>

* **name()**  
    - `return` the pipeline name
